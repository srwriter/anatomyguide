# The skull

Learning the skull's proportions will help you draw the head and face, and understand the depth of features and distances between them.

You can divide the skull into <mark style="color:blue;">two or three sections</mark> as seen in figure below. \
The <mark style="background-color:red;">red dots</mark> next to each figure mark significant areas to note when drawing the head.
