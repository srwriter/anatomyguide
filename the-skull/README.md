# The skull

Learning the skull's proportions will help you draw the head and face in proportion, and understand the depth of features and distances between them.

You can divide the skull into <mark style="color:blue;">two or three sections</mark> as seen in figure **A** below. You don't need to know all the anatomical terms of the skull, but it can help you remember the sections when drawing.



{% hint style="info" %}
The red dots next to each figure mark significant areas to note when drawing the head.

### Male vs. female skull

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/female vs. male skull-srobinson.tif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The female skull is smaller than the male skull and more slender in form.

**Forehead:**

In the side view of the male and female skulls, you'll notice that the male skull has a more pronounced glabella and brow bridge **(D)**, making the male forehead appear more flat or slanted. By contrast, the female forehead is high and more rounded because of the larger frontal eminences **(A)**.

**Temple:** temple lines are more pronounced in the male skull **(E)**.\


**Eye sockets:** female skulls have rounder eye orbits and sharper supraorbital edges **(C)**.\


**Jaw line:** the male chin is broad and more square, as the mandible body is wider **(F)** and the jaw line has a steeper angle **(G)**. In males, the angle could be 90 degrees, but it is usually 100-120 degrees. \


The female chin is more rounded and pointed, and the jaw narrower with a wider angle - up to 120-140 degrees **(B)**.
