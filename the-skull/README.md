# The skull

Learning the skull's proportions will help you draw the head and face, and understand the depth of features and distances between them.

You can divide the skull into <mark style="color:blue;">two or three sections</mark> as seen in figure below. \
The <mark style="background-color:red;">red dots</mark> next to each figure mark significant areas to note when drawing the head.

### Male vs. female skull



The female skull is smaller than the male skull and more slender in form.

**A.** The female forehead is high and more rounded because of the larger frontal eminences.

**B.** The female chin is more round and pointed, and the jaw is narrower with a wider angle - up to 120-140 degrees.

**C.** Female skulls have rounder eye orbits and sharper supraorbital edges.

**D.** In the side view of the male and female skulls above, you'll notice that the male skull has a more pronounced glabella and brow bridge, making the male forehead appear more flat or slanted.

**E.** Eye sockets: temple lines are more pronounced in the male skull.

**F**. Jawline: the male chin is broad and square, as the mandible body is wider and the jawline has a steeper angle **(G)**. In males, the angle could be 90 degrees, but it is usually 100-120 degrees.
