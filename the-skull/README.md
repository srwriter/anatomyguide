# The skull

Learning how the sections of the skull will help you draw the head and face in proportion, and understand the depth of features and distances between them.

You can divide the skull into <mark style="color:blue;">two or three sections</mark> as seen in figure **A** below. You don't need to know all the anatomical terms of the skull, but it can help you remember the sections when drawing.

{% hint style="info" %}
The red dots next to each figure mark significant areas to note when drawing the head.
